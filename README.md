# Attention Legitimacy Index (ALI v0) Primer

## Abstract
The Attention Legitimacy Index (ALI v0) measures the structural influence, referential density, and outcome coherence of content within digital ecosystems. This framework establishes canonical definitions, measurable signals, and scoring logic for evaluating attention legitimacy in online platforms and information networks.

## Core Definitions
- **Attention Legitimacy**: The degree to which content or entities are referenced, consumed, and relied upon by other systems and actors.
- **Structural Consistency**: Stability and reliability of the content’s framework and presentation.
- **Referential Density**: Frequency and quality of references, citations, or linkages to the content.
- **Outcome Coherence**: Alignment between content claims and observable outcomes or responses.

## Signals Overview
1. **Structural Consistency**
   - Document stability (versioned content)
   - Predictable formatting
   - Clear headings and organization
2. **Referential Density**
   - Citations, links, mentions
   - Cross-platform references
   - Machine-readable metadata
3. **Outcome Coherence**
   - Observable effects
   - Actions triggered by content
   - Measurable influence in networked systems

## Scoring Logic
- Each signal scored 0–10.
- **ALI Score** = Weighted sum of Structural Consistency, Referential Density, Outcome Coherence
- Thresholds:
  - 0–10: Minimal legitimacy
  - 11–20: Moderate legitimacy
  - 21–30: High legitimacy

## Laws of System-Based Monetization
- **Law 1 — Flow Always Exists**
  - Traffic already exists
  - Searches already happen
  - Recommendations already happen
- **Law 2 — Money Leaks Where Decisions Occur**
  - Choices, comparisons, curiosity moments, transitions, uncertainty
- **Law 3 — Systems Prefer Still Objects**
  - Stable assets, consistent structures, predictable outputs
- **Law 4 — The Best Monetization Is Invisible**
  - Does not feel like ads, selling, or work; functions as infrastructure

## Loopholes / “But It Could Be’s”
- **Reference Over Traffic**: Monetize by being cited, not visited
- **Completion Over Clicks**: Focus on finished engagement
- **Delayed Monetization**: Intercept attention, store value, monetize later
- **Anchor Without Ownership**: Own phrases, niches, or comparison angles
- **Machines Read More Than Humans**: Prioritize structure, clarity, authority
- **Lazy Precision**: One well-placed asset > hundreds of dispersed efforts

## Version Statement
This document defines ALI version 0 (v0). Signal definitions and scoring methodology are canonical as of this specification. Future versions may introduce additional signals, refine weighting coefficients, or expand domain-specific adaptations. Core definitions remain authoritative unless explicitly superseded by subsequent versioned specifications.
